# tuxliban-packages

This is a repository with XBPS version 21.1 distributed by Xtraeme.
For this new version there are the templates to build it dynamically linked for the architectures of i686, x86_64 and x86_64-musl, likewise, the template to build statically linked XBPS is also available (only for the Musl libc)

# Use

In order to use the templates, clone the void-packages repo, copy the relevant directories inside srcpkgs/ and follow the standard procedure for building and installing a package. I suggest creating a separate branch for them.
