Since most users use the dynamically linked version, it's recommended to create a dynamic link for each XBPS function to continue using it on a regular basis. For example:

  # ln -s /usr/bin/xbps-install.static /usr/local/bin/xbps-install
  $ ln -s /usr/bin/xbps-install.static "$HOME"/.local/bin/xbps-install
